# NeoVim Configuration 

## Introduction
This is my personal NeoVim configuration, hosted on GitHub for ease of access. It's a single-file setup, intentionally kept simple and straightforward for my own use.

- **Line Numbers**: Absolute and relative line numbers enabled for better navigation.
- **Clipboard Sharing**: Integrated clipboard between NeoVim and the OS.
- **Tab Settings**: Configured for 2-space indentation.
